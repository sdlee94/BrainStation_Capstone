## What are DeepFakes?

Take a look at this GIF. Which one do you think is the original clip?

Difficult, right? Especially if you don't know what movie this is from. Did you know this was generated by a computer? Well if you aren't aware, this is a **DeepFake**, an altered video produced by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. DeepFakes are not just limited to face swapping, any aspect of digital media is subject to 'DeepFaking' - a person's mouth movements can be adjusted to match any audio sample, for instance. This technology brings major implications to society. From spreading false information to fabricating evidence in court to sabotaging politics, it's not hard to imagine the many dangers of DeepFakes if left unchecked. Imagine if DeepFakes were to come out today of health officials and political figures saying that the Covid-19 pandemic is over, everyone can go out and socialize - the consequences would be disastrous!

## DeepFake Detection Challenge  

In an effort to curb the emerging threat of DeepFakes, a [**Kaggle competition**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/overview) was built in collaboration between Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Partnership on AI to invite enthusiasts of all backgrounds to compete for the best performing DeepFake detection model. As someone who loves challenging problems and has genuine concerns about DeepFakes, I chose to tackle this challenge for my capstone project. Over the course of ~7 weeks I performed an end-to-end Data Science workflow in which I obtained data, processed it and trained several deep learning models to differentiate between real and fake videos. To date, my best model achieved **96% precision** (of all predicted fakes, 96% were indeed fake) and **83% specificity** (able to correctly identify 83% of real videos) using just a single frame per video. Below details the tools used for this project and an overview of the steps I took to get there!

### Dataset

Due to computational and time limitations, I opted to use a pre-processed dataset which consisted of 160x160 resolution images of extracted faces from the original videos. Credits goes to *Hieu Phung* for generating this [**dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge/discussion/128954) - information about the pre-processing workflow can be found [**here**](https://www.kaggle.com/phunghieu/deepfake-detection-face-extractor).


The dataset was split into several parts, with a zip file containing a variable number of folders with each containing a set of images pertaining to a unique video. Each zip file also came with a metadata.csv file which had the ids and labels of the associated 'videos'. Each data batch came in a zip file in the naming format of 'deepfake-detection-faces-part-i-j.zip' where 'i-j' refers to the batch number. I created a bash script *unzip_batch.sh* to unzip a zip file given a batch number and appropriately rename its associated metadata file with 'metadata_i-j.csv'. All metadata were consolidated into a single metadata file with this simple bash command:

`cat data/metadata*.csv > data/metadata.csv`

### Tools Used
- Bash
- Python
- Github
- Google Colab

#### Python Packages:
- **Data Science**: numpy, pandas
- **Plotting**: matplotlib
- **Machine Learning**: tensorflow version 2.1, keras
- **Other**: jupyter, os, imageio, pickle, h5py
